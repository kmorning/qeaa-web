      <p>We observe all Alcoholics Anonymous principles and Traditions on our web site. As anonymity is the "spiritual foundation of all our Traditions", we practice anonymity on our web site at all times. The Quinte East District 34 web site is a public medium which has the potential for reaching the broadest possible audience and, therefore, requires the same safeguards that we use at the level of press, radio and film.</p>
